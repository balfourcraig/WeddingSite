                    <div class="faqAnswer">
                        <p>Between cities the trains are great. Within the city the easiest option is a taxi. Taxis in China are pretty cheap.</p>
                        <p>For the taxis, use _(more info coming)_ and pay with AliPay. See the <a href="payments.html">payments page</a> for more on money, or the <a href="gettingAround.html">getting around and attractions page</a> for more info on things to do.</p>

                    <h2 class="faqQuestion">How many people speak English?</h2>
                    <div class="faqAnswer">
                        <p>In bigger cities more people will, and younger people tend to speak more English than older, but on the whole most people do not speak good English.</p>
                        <p>It's a good idea to get familiar with Google Translate. Some hotels will have an English speaker on the staff, though it's often limited. Resturants who are used to tourists will also have a picture menu which you can point at.</p>

                    <div class="faqAnswer">
                        <p>It's a hard language! If you want to learn a little, Busuu and Duolingo are both good apps. Learning a few phrases might help too.</p>
